## Why I made this?
Hey ... So, I tried to make an Editor like Vim but in Rust. So I called it "LIM". I'm learning Rust so I wanted something new ...

## When it will be completed?
Well, currently I am facing some issues with the editor. Like the editor.rs is not working as expected. Fixing them and publishing the software wouldn't take so long but it will be released in a month or so.

## Can we help?
Yep, you can help me!
